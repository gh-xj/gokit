# agentcli-go Skill

## In scope

- `agentcli` package usage (`ParseArgs`, `RunCommand`, `FileExists`, etc.).
- Scaffold flow (`agentcli new`, `agentcli add command`, `agentcli doctor`).
- Runtime conventions for `cobrax`, config precedence, and `task verify` compatibility.

## Use this when

- You need expected output for a new scaffold project.
- You need migration/debugging guidance for helper APIs.
- You need predictable CLI behavior before implementation decisions.

## Install quick check

- `go install github.com/gh-xj/agentcli-go/cmd/agentcli@v0.2.2`
- `which agentcli`
- `agentcli --help`

## Loop integration

- `skills/loop-governance/SKILL.md` for project-level loop policy.
- `skills/verification-loop/SKILL.md` for command-level quality workflows.

## Agent onboarding

Use [`../agents.md`](../agents.md) for the local agent checklist.

## Out of scope

- This skill does not define profile policy or loop strategy.
- It does not replace project-specific verification playbooks in `skills/verification-loop/*`.
