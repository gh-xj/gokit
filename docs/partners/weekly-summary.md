## Quantitative Summary

## Top Frictions

1. Generated command descriptions are generic and need domain edits.
2. Users want richer domain presets/examples.
3. Installation is improving, but binary-first onboarding should be highlighted more.

## Decisions This Week

1. Keep strict contract-first onboarding flow as default.
2. Prioritize runnable examples and prompt-driven onboarding.

## Next Week Plan

1. Add command description options to scaffold command generation.
2. Add install verification snippet and benchmark section in README.
3. Onboard external partners (not only internal repos).
